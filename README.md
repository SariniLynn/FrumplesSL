FrumplesSL
==========

In the wake of the Skill Gaming updates of August 2014, many things in Second Life are disappearing lest they be caught in the skill gaming net.  The once-popular Frumples breedables fall into this category.  As such, I am putting my Frumple-related utilities online as reference material for LSL coders who may take up similar projects in the future.

You will find binary data management throughout, a very brief example of Artificial Intelligence (in The Grand Jester), one example of how to create an automatic updater (in FrumpleBumper), and (I like to think) some positive usability ideas.

This code is released under the MIT license, which simply put means you may use it.  For anything, including commercial purposes.  Of course, since Frumples are no more, I don't suggest trying to sell it as-is...  ;)

I ask, but do not require, that you include a link back to this repository with any substantial portion of my code that you release.  (A comment in the code will suffice.)  Shared knowledge makes a stronger Second Life.
